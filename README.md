# Decision-Tree-Classifier-for-Iris_Dataset
This repository contains a Python notebook that demonstrates the use of a decision tree classifier on the famous Iris dataset.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and is often used as a beginner's dataset for classification and clustering tasks. It contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The measurements include the length and width of the sepals and petals in centimeters.

## Installation
To run the notebook, ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
### You can install these libraries using pip as follows:

* pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
## Notebook Contents
### The notebook contains the following sections:

1. Loading the dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Preprocessing the data
4. Applying Decision Tree Classifier algorithm
5. Visualizing the decision tree

* In this notebook, I have used scikit-learn library to apply Decision Tree Classifier algorithm on the Iris dataset. I have also visualized the decision tree using graphviz and matplotlib libraries.

## Usage
To run the notebook, simply open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run each cell sequentially. You can modify the code as per your requirements and experiment with different parameters.

## Conclusion
Decision Tree Classifier is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification tasks. In this notebook, I have demonstrated the use of Decision Tree Classifier on the Iris dataset and visualized the decision tree using different techniques.

I hope this notebook helps you understand the basics of Decision Tree Classifier and how it can be applied to real-world datasets. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me.
